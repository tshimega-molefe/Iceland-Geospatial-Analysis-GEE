# Earth Engine Python API Workshop for Geospatial Analysis in Iceland

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our workshop on cloud-based geospatial analysis using the Earth Engine Python API, tailored for applications in Iceland. This workshop was featured at the 2023 Geo for Good Summit and is designed to equip participants with the foundational skills necessary to leverage the powerful Earth Engine platform for environmental and geospatial data analysis.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in applying Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor environmental and geospatial data, with a focus on use cases relevant to Iceland. The workshop introduces attendees to the basics of the Earth Engine data types, visualization techniques, analysis, and data export capabilities within a Jupyter notebook environment, utilizing geemap for enhanced mapping functionalities.

## What You Will Learn

- **Introduction to Earth Engine Data Types**: Understand the various data types available within Earth Engine and how they can be utilized for geospatial analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn how to visualize Earth Engine data effectively using geemap in a Jupyter notebook, making your data analysis more intuitive and accessible.
- **Data Analysis and Export**: Gain insights into analyzing Earth Engine data to derive meaningful environmental metrics and learn how to export your data for further use.
- **Interactive Earth Engine Web Apps**: Discover how to develop and deploy interactive web applications powered by Earth Engine and Python, enabling broader access to your geospatial analyses.
- **Hands-On Exercises**: Enhance your learning experience through practical examples and hands-on exercises provided in Google Colab notebooks, guided by our instructors.

## For Whom Is This Workshop?

This workshop is ideal for environmental scientists, researchers, policy makers, and anyone interested in leveraging cloud-based geospatial analysis for environmental monitoring and decision-making, with a specific focus on Iceland. Whether you are monitoring renewable energy resources, assessing the impact of tourism, or analyzing urban expansion, this workshop provides the necessary tools and knowledge to apply GEE effectively.
