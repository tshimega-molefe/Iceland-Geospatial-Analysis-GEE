# Iceland Renewable Energy Analysis with Google Earth Engine

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE) for in-depth analysis of renewable energy potential in Iceland, focusing on geothermal and hydroelectric power opportunities. This initiative, spearheaded by Leviathan, aims to harness the extensive satellite imagery and analysis capabilities of GEE to identify, evaluate, and optimize renewable energy investments in Iceland's unique geological and hydrological landscape.

## Overview

Iceland stands on the forefront of renewable energy production, largely due to its abundant geothermal resources and extensive waterways. This repository focuses on the application of GEE to map geothermal activity and water flow patterns, thereby guiding investors towards high-potential projects and informing the development of sustainable energy infrastructure.

## Objectives

- **Identify Geothermal Energy Potential**: Utilize GEE to analyze surface temperature data and thermal anomalies across Iceland, highlighting areas with significant geothermal energy potential.
- **Map Hydroelectric Power Opportunities**: Analyze precipitation data, snowmelt patterns, and river flow rates to pinpoint locations ideal for hydroelectric power generation.
- **Assess Environmental Impacts**: Employ satellite imagery to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of renewable energy projects, ensuring alignment with sustainability goals.
- **Inform Strategic Investment Decisions**: Integrate geospatial analysis with financial models to forecast project feasibility, costs, and returns, thereby optimizing investment strategies.
